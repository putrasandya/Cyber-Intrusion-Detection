# Cyber-Intrusion-Detection
Cyber Intrusion Detection using XGBoost Regressor

This project is designed to detecting cyber intrutions based on user behavior. We will using dataset from /kaggle/input/cybersecurity-intrusion-detection-dataset and develop XGBoost model for prediction.

# ConclusionÂ¶
The model's average prediction error is 0.1841, in the same unit as the target.
The MSE is lower than the MAE, meaning that large errors are not overly dominant in this model.
The model explains 62.83% of the variability in the data.

# Improvement
Add new features (Feature Engineering) to better capture patterns.
Try different models such as Random Forest or Neural Networks.
Use Hyperparameter Tuning (e.g., GridSearchCV).
